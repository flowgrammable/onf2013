binding :
  lhs type must match rhs type
  lhs gets typed the first time it is used
  visit through -assignee to type check, type is either a list name
    or a literal type(maybe not, might be tough to do)

assignee :
  
address :
  is of form proto ip|port ip|port
  the valid protos are either tcp, or tls
  if tcp, must specify first port, else don't have to
  if tls, and port not specified, manually add the default
  ip addresses can be -ipv4 or -ipv6 (no id or fqdn yet)
  ports can be any unsigned 16bit int
  if a second addr|port pair is there, must be a listener in a connection

ipv4 :
  check each digits group is only 3 digits
  then check that the 3 digit values are less than 256
  (maybe check that there are no units on the digits?)

ipv6 :
  check that each group is only 4 digits
  check that each group is a valid hex number up to 0xffff
  (once again, maybe check that there are no units...)

network
  check the ip
  check the mask, if ipv4, max_mask = 32
  else max_mask = 128

identifier :
  anything that is still this type will be a symbol representing a variable
  
The types in the language are:
Base_Type
  Built_in
    Int
    Str
    Hex
    Version
    MSec
    Addr
    Conn
    Ipv4
    Ipv6
    Network
    Time
  Stage
  List
